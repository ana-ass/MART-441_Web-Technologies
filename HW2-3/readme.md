The website I created was simple but it had a personal, human touch with the inclusion of my cat and the text.  The generative AI made a simple website, with the background color and plain text describing the assignment.  The console log that the AI made, were very impersonal and the lack of relation or human touch in answers was very telling.  It was unprofessional with uses of emojis, and tried making the prompt variable more complex.  The color choices were very plain from the GPT site, and the spacing in the console log was off.

It felt wrong, using a generative AI to create a website.  If I had to rely only on AI generated output I do not think I could call myself an artist or designer.  It felt wrong, and completely against everything I believed to even use it for this assignment.  I think design and websites are personal, especially artist-made websites.  These websites all include personal pieces of who made them, whether it be how they comment, colors chosen, or layout.  I am a firm believer in doing your own work, and while yes you can take inspiration from someone or something, it's imperative to remind yourself that YOU are a good designer because of your own influence.

I could explain the code that was written by the AI, I understood the logistics behind the choices and wording used in the code.  It was all very textbook code even some that was included in our lesson.

The work I created feels like my own, not the GPT generated site, because I used my personal pet and color choices for the website.  The writing in the console log is how I write, I can see my personality reflected in it.  As a web designer, I reject generative AI in the use of any creative or personal process even in my daily life outside of academics.
