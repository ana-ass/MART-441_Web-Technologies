                <h1>My Overall Theme</h1>
                <p>The theme I chose for my website is based around deer and nature.  This is purposeful, and is meant to reflect the recent journey I have been taking with my art.  I have been drawing out my grief of losing my father through forest and deer imagery, so I would like my website to reflect that.  The ultimate goal is to make an interactive portfolio website where I can showcase my current finished and future art pieces.  The website itself will also be an art piece brought together by my vision and my code.</p>

                    <h2>My Game Experience</h2>
                    <p>One thing about me is that I have always had an interest in video games, for as long as I can remember.  I was introduced to video games by my brother and my dad, who I would often watch play these games or who would let me play these games with them.  These memories have become my basis of enjoying and wanting to design video games for others to enjoy.  I have participated in a couple of fan-made game projects as a video editor, writer, and even part of the leading dev teams.</p>
                </br>
                    <p>A fond memory I have of playing a video game was with Black Ops 3.  My brother and I would stay up for hours trying to complete the zombie levels, and it is when we had our most fun playing video games.  One night I vividly remember accidentally triggering a continuation in the story that we had been stuck on for hours.  While I cannot recall how exactly I completed it, the excitement we shared and fun we had playing cemented itself into my memory.  It has become such a fun memory, that any time we visit home for the holidays we always plan a couple of late night CoD Zombie sessions and have shared that time with our younger brother as well.</p>
