Generative AI Response:

After recreating the homework assignment with ChaptGPT, I can not find anything about the code that I liked.  While the code was straight forward and fit most of the requirements, there was a lack of heart in the writing.  It was a simple woods exploring story, with no experience or soul added into the words.  The CSS sheet was straight forward and used basic colors, such as black and white to format the website.  The html file was formatted well but had information that wasn't needed, or was made redundant by the css style file.  The javascript for the adventure was more advanced than we had learned in class, with little to no commentary on what blocks of code were.  While I can identify the advanced code, I cannot find myself liking it because I know I can't explain it and I shouldn't rely on code I can't explain.  

The website ChatGPT works, but that is all that it does.  It works, and does not think about the audience or think ahead in the story.  People like to feel a part of things, especially a choose your own adventure story and that key part of the website is what the AI lacked.  My story includes a personal experience that many people have dealt with before.  Whether it be their pet, siblings, parents, or just nature you always have something interrupting or impeding on your work and it can be fun exploring why that happens.


Successes/Challenges:

My biggest challenge for this website was the applicaiton of my CSS file.  Whenever I tried to style the webpage, I began to lose my buttons after the first press.  A lot of the help I looked for was at an advanced level, and did not help me immediately fix the issue.  So after reviewing what I knew about CSS, I began to slowly rebuild the code making one line visible at a time.  I figured out through this process of elimination that the css was making the .innerHTML disappear completely.  So I moved the buttons outside of my divclass, and they stayed after clicking.  I adjusted my style a bit more, and was finally happy with the result that changed with the buttons.  While I could have simply copied the advanced guides, I chose to stick with what I knew because any code I write I should understand, so I can play with it or apply it in other places instead of it "just working".

My biggest success was how quickly I could come up with my story and my style.  I knew instantly what aesthetic I wanted to go for, and how to make the website more readable.  Being an artist helps with this, because I know how to make certain features or colors stand out as a result.  I would love to continue the bit of Bella the Coding Cat for these stories as she is my biggest assistant with my current indie game development.
